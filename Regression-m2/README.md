Apply sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression to Bread and Peace (Voting in Postwar US Presidential Elections) dataset to model the relationship between “Growth in Personal Incomes” and “US Military Fatalities” as independent features and “Incumbent Party Vote Share” as the target label. Training and test data are split based on the dates to avoid leaking into the future. The MAE, MSE, and R2 Scores are compared where fit with different polynomial degrees to explore underfitting (less complex model, high bias, training score close to validation score) and overfitting (more complex model, high variance, high training score but low validation score).
